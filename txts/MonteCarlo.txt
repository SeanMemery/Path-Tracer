Used to get estimate for integration.

Says that the value of the the integral of a function f over a domain [a,b]
is equal to the expected value of the the estimator:

F_N = (b - a)/N sum^N_i( f( X_i ) ) 

i.e. int^b_a(f(x)) = E[ F_N ]

This is true for uniform random number X, so for a random number X from an 
arbitrary pdf p(x)

F_N = 1/N sum^N_i( f(X_i) / p(X_i) )
