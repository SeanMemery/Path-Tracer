Luminance = 0.2125R+0.7154G+0.0721B, for RGB radiance values

Want to get L value used to scale the scenes luminance, 
Lagard and de Rousiers, 2014 (pg. 85) method is:

EV100 = log_2(L_avg * S / K)
Lmax = 78 * 2^(EV100) / (qS)
H = 1/L_max

S is the Sensor sensitivity, 
K is the reflected-light meter calibration constant, 
q is the lens and vignetting attentuation, 
H is the exposure 
L_avg is the average scene luminance

Use values:
S = 100
K = 12.5
q = 0.65

L_max = 9.6 * L_avg

Therefore, final scaled luminance is 

L' = H*L = L / L_max = L / (9.6 * L_avg)
