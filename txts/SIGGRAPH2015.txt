Three main optical catagories of materials (based on electrical properties):
1) Metals (Conductors)
2) Dielectrics (Insulators)
3) Semiconductors

Semiconductors aren't often considered so materials can be broken down to:
1) Metals (Immediately absorb all refracted light)
2) Non-Metals (Refracted light is scattered/absorbed to some degree, then reflected back out)

Relfected light is split into two catagories, diffuse and specular. 

Bidirectional relfectance Distribution Function (BRDF) (f(l,v)):
A function of light direction l and the view direction v representing the variation of light response on a surface
Used to solve the reflectance equation for outgoing radiance at a point
Lo(v) = Int[ f(l,v) x Li(l) (n.l) ] 
{
	Lo(v) = outgoing radiance
	Int[] = integrating over all incoming radiances
	Li(l) = incoming radiance along direction l
	x = component wise RGB multiplication
}


-------------------------------------------------------------

DIFFUSE
Light leaving the material after being absorbed and bounced around
For rendering purposes we often treat this light as leaving at the same point as entering
Sub-Surface Scattering: when diffuse lighting leaves at a different point that it entered
Leaves at reandom angle


Lambert model is the most common diffuse term, the simplest BRDF, just a constant value
F_lambert(l,v) = c_diff / pi
c_diff = fraction of light reflected, or diffuse colour 


-------------------------------------------------------------

SPECULAR
Light reflected off material
Leaves at reflected angle with tighter randomness


Microfacet Specular BRDF (used for specular lighting):
The idea is that sufaces have micro geometry that is visibally small but still affects light
Each point is trated as a perfect mirror relfecting all light in one outgoing direction
The only microfacets that contribute are those with a normal exactly half-way between l and v

f(l,v) = F(l,h) . G(l,v,h) . D(h)
		-------------------------
			4(n.l) . (n.v)
{
	h = normal of microfacet geometry
	F(l,h) = Fresnal Reflectance, fraction of incoming light that is relfected rather than refracted
		   = Surface's charachteristic specular colour, based on reflectance values for differetn materials and incidence angle
		   = F_schlick(F0, l, h) = F0 + (1-F0)(1 - (l.h))^5, schlicks approximation for fresnal distributions of materials 

	D(h) = microfacet normal distribution function, NDF, gives the concentration of microfacet normals pointing in a given direction, relative to surface area (determines the size and shape of highlight)
		 = various options (google)

	G(l,v,h) = Geometry Function, gives the chance that a microfacet with given orientation h is lit and visible (i.e. not shadowed or masked)
			 = lots of options but best is the Smith Function Gs(l,v,h) = Gs1(l,h) . Gs1(v,h)
