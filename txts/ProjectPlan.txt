1) Basic Neural Renderer (Reduce/MapReduce)(MapOverlap for CNN)(MapPairs/MapPairsReduce for NN too)
2) Denoising Alg (Reduce ?)
3) Point Cloud Rendering (?)(solving ODEs to update positions ? )
4) Ray Marching Volume Rendering (MapReduce on getting nearest shape from list, map get distances then reduce with min )
