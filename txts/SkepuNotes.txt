1. SkePU warning given when running without updated gou inf. SkePU doesnt recognise GPU on laptop, need to edit 
    skepu-headers/src/skepu3/backend/device_cu.h
adding gpu information (120, 32)

2. For OMP implementations, watch out for different threads overriding vairables i.e. dont declare a common variable outside of the omp loops
    - Not necessary in SkePU OMP TALK ABOUT

3. Huge issue with worldPos
    - creating stdDev squared thats smaller than actual difference between nearby values
    - This leads to large value causing a weight value of 0, ruining the whole sum
    - causes a weight value of 1 only at the origin pixel, leading to an unchanged filtered image
