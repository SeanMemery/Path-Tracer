1. SkePU warning given when running without updated gou inf. SkePU doesnt recognise GPU on laptop, need to edit 
    - skepu-headers/src/skepu3/backend/device_cu.h
    - adding gpu information (120, 32)

2. For OMP implementations, watch out for different threads overriding vairables i.e. dont declare a common variable outside of the omp loops
    - Not necessary in SkePU OMP TALK ABOUT

3. Huge issue with worldPos
    - creating stdDev squared thats smaller than actual difference between nearby values
    - This leads to large value causing a weight value of 0, ruining the whole sum
    - causes a weight value of 1 only at the origin pixel, leading to an unchanged filtered image
    - FIX: have removed worlPosStdDev from weight calc, now variance val should change accordingly, REMEMBER THIS

4. Going to try add a new variance value, i.e. ML calculated value. This will be a brightness setting for the pixel, as its quite difficult to directly brighten the pixels i feel, ill see how it goes
    - FAILURE: seems to only change brightness of screen, very weird

5. Done some strange things to light sampling to make it look more even with indirect lighting, basically jut threw in the distance to shape TODO FIX!!!
