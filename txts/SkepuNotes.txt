1. SkePU warning given when running without updated gou inf. SkePU doesnt recognise GPU on laptop, need to edit 
    skepu-headers/src/skepu3/backend/device_cu.h
adding gpu information (120, 32)

2. For OMP implementations, watch out for different threads overriding vairables i.e. dont declare a common variable outside of the omp loops
    - Not necessary in SkePU OMP TALK ABOUT

3. Huge issue with worldPos
    - creating stdDev squared thats smaller than actual difference between nearby values
    - This leads to large value causing a weight value of 0, ruining the whole sum
    - causes a weight value of 1 only at the origin pixel, leading to an unchanged filtered image
    - FIX: have removed worlPosStdDev from weight calc, now variance val should change accordingly, REMEMBER THIS

4. Going to try add a new variance value, i.e. ML calculated value. This will be a brightness setting for the pixel, as its quite difficult to directly brighten the pixels i feel, ill see how it goes
    - FAILURE: seems to only change brightness of screen, very weird

5. Problem with denoising spheres, filter isnt affecting spheres at all, normal related ? 
    - Not to do with spheres, its the area in front of the camera, not being denoised at all 
    - not to do with world pos stan dev
    - its to do with the small vals added to the std dev and variance
    - actually, might be to do with std dev with random sampling, as its more effective in the centre
